# Break-Project---League of Legends (LOL) Killuns

This project aims to serve players of Riot's League of Legends game with real-time data on their latest 10 games played, as well as overall info since the player has begun.

- What is the goal of the project?
  * Play with a game API (League Of Legends, or LOL) while also dealing with stats.
  * Gain better handle on web page flow/presentation - didn't really get to this
- Who is the target audience 
  * People who play LOL
- What are your personal learning goals?
  * Understand an API independently 
  * Work with javascript page rendering - didn't get to this
  * CSS styling 
- What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
  * LOL API calls
  * JSON
  * Ruby
  * Pomodoro  
  * HTML/CSS/JS
- What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
  * LOL API key
  * LOL API being live (no downtime)
  * making API calls and parsing response  
- What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
  * Text box for input of summoner name, and results of your latest played champion and associated game data
  * A nifty way of presenting the data that conveys it better than the numbers (thumbnails of characters? Percentages?)
  * I'll see what else I can get back in the API response and go from there
