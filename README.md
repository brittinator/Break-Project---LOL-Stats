# Break-Project---LOL-Stats

Project Baseline

* Mode: Summoner's Rift
* Input will be Summoner Name
* Output will be stats on who killed them.
  * Roles - Assassin, Fighter, Mage, Support, Tank, Marksman
  * By Percentage
  * Filter by what your champion was, and who killed you the most  


Anticipate spending 10-15 hours on this project over the break week.
Do at least an hour of thinking and research about a small, web-based project you would like to build. Focus on something you believe you can ship by the end of the week.
Spend time thinking about the scope of the project. What does done look like? What is the minimum viable project that you could ship that accomplishes the goal of your project?
Create a repository on your personal Github account to house your project.
Author and push a README (in plain text or markdown) that describes your project:

- What is the goal of the project?
  * Play with a game API (League Of Legends, or LOL) while also dealing with stats.
  * Gain better handle on web page flow/presentation  
- Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
  * People who play LOL (probably just Travis)  
- What are your personal learning goals?
  * Work with javascript page rendering
  * Understand an API independently (no one else I know has worked with this)
  * CSS styling (drop down menus, clean lines, etc)  
- What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
  * LOL API calls
  * JSON
  * HTML/CSS/JS
  * Possibly Ruby for storing info about champion information constants ??
  * Pomodoro  
- What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
  * LOL API key
  * making API calls and parsing response  
- What does success look like for this project? What does done mean?
  * Text box for input of summoner name, and results of your latest played champion and who killed you (initially limit to last 5 played)
  * A nifty way of presenting the data that conveys it better than the numbers (thumbnails of characters? Percentages?)
  * I'll see what else I can get back in the API response and go from there
