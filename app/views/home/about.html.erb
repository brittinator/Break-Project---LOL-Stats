      <h2>About LOL Killuns</h2>
      <p>
        This started as a project during a break from attending
        <%= link_to 'Ada Developers Academy', 'http://adadevelopersacademy.org/' %>.
        I couldn't put it down until I had a version that was live and I was happy with.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a lot of fun with LOL Killuns and working with the League of Legend API.
        I hope you will enjoy it too.
